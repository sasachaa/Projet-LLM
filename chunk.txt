11 1.1, 8 The promise of Al Although we might have unrealistic short-term expectations for AI, the long-term picture is looking bright. We are only just getting started in applying deep learning to many important problems in which it could prove transtormative, from medical diagnoses to digital assistants, While AI research has been moving forward amazingly fast in the past five years, in large part due to a wave of funding never seen before in the short history of A.I, SO far relatively little of this progress has made its way into the products and processes that make up our world, Most of the research findings of deep learning are not yet applied, or at least not applied to the full range of problems that they can solve across all industries. Your doctor doesn't yet use AI, your accountant doesn't yet use AI. Yourself, you probably don't use AI technologies in your day-to-day life. Of course, you can ask simple questions to your smartphone and get reasonable answers, You can get fairly useful product recommendations on Amazon.com. You can search for "birthday" on Google Photos and instantly find those pictures of your daughter's birthday party from last month. That's a far cry from where such technologies used to stand. But such tools are still just accessory to our daily lives, AI has yet to transition to become central to the Right now it may seem hard to believe that AI could have a large impact on our world, because at this point AI is not yet widely deployed-much like it would have been difficult to believe in the future impact of the Internet back in 1995, Back then most people did not see how the Internet was relevant to them, how it was going to change their lives. The same is true for deep learning and AI today. But make no mistake: AI is coming. In a not SO distant future, AI will be your assistant, even your friend; it will answer your questions, it will help educate your kids, and it will watch over your health, Itwill deliver your groceries to your door and it will drive you from point A to point B. It will be your interface to an increasingly complex and increasingly information-intensive world, And even more importantly, AI will help humanity as a whole move forwards, by assisting human scientists in new breakthrough discoveries across all scientific fields, On the road to get there, we might face a few setbacks, and maybe a new AI winter in much the same way that the Internet industry got overhyped in 1998-1999 and suffered from a crash that dried up investment throughout the early 2000s, But we will get there eventually. AI will end up being applied to nearly every process that makes up Don't believe the short-term hype, but do believe in the long-term vision. It may take a while for AI to get deployed to its true potential a potential the full extent of which no one has yet dared to dream but AI is coming, and it will transform our world in a way we work, think and live, from genomics to mathematics. our society and our daily lives, much like the Internet today. fantastic way.

12 1.2 Before deep learning: a brief history of machine learning Deep learning has reached a level of public attention and industry investment never seen before in the history of AI, but it isn't the first successful form of machine learning, In fact, it's a safe bet to say that most of the machine learning algorithms in use in the industry today are still not deep learning algorithms. Deep learning isn't always the right tool for the job-sometimes there just isn't enough data for deep learning to be applicable, and sometimes the problem is simply better solved by a different algorithm, If deep learning is your first contact with machine learning, then you may find yourselfin: a situation where all you have is the deep learning hammer and every machine learning problem starts looking like a nail for this hammer. The only way not to fall into this trap isto be familiar with other approaches and practice them when appropriate, A detailed exposure of classical machine learning approaches is outside of the scope ofthis book, but we will briefly go over them and describe the historical context in which they were developed. This will allow us to place deep learning in the broader context of machine learning, and better understand where deep learning comes from and why it matters. 1.2, 1 Probabilistic modeling Probabilistic modeling is the application of the principles of statistics to data analysis. It was one of the earliest forms of machine learning, yet it is still widely used to this day. One of the best-known algorithms in this category is the Naive Bayes algorithm, Naive Bayes is a type of machine learning classifier based on applying the Bayes Theorem while assuming that the features in the input data are all independent (a strong, or "naive" assumption, which is where the name comes from). This form of data analysis actually predates computers, and was applied by hand decades before its first computer implementation (most likely dating back to the 1950s), The Bayes Theorem and the foundations of statistics themselves date back to the 18th century, and these are all you A closely related model is the Logistic Regression (logreg for short), which is sometimes considered to be the "hello world" of modern machine learning. Don't be misled by its name logreg is in fact a classification algorithm rather than a regression algorithm, Much like Naive Bayes, logreg predates computing by a long time, yet it is still very useful to this day, thanks to its simple and versatile nature. It is often the first thing a data scientist will try on a dataset to get a feel for the classification task at hand. need to start using Naive Bayes classifiers.
