Welcome Thank you for purchasing the MEAP for Deep Learning with Python, If you are looking for a resource to learn about deep learning from scratch and to quickly become able to use this knowledge to solve real-world problems, you have found the right book. *Deep Learning with Python* is meant for engineers and students with a reasonable amount of Python experience, but no significant knowledge of machine learning and deep learning, It will take you all the way from basic theory to advanced practical applications. However, if you already have experience with deep learning, you should still be able to find value in Deep learning is an immensely rich subfield of machine learning, with powerful applications ranging from machine perception to natural language processing, all the way up to creative AI, Yet, its core concepts are in fact very simple. Deep learning is often presented as shrouded in a certain mystique, with references to algorithms that work like the brain", that "think" or "understand". Reality is however quite far from this science fiction dream, and I will do my best in these pages to dispel these illusions, I believe that there are no difficult ideas in deep learning, and that's why I started this book, based on premise that all of the important concepts and applications in this field could be taught to This book is structured around a series of practical code examples, demonstrating on real world problems every the notions that gets introduced, I strongly believe in the value of teaching using concrete examples, anchoring theoretical ideas into actual results and tangible code patterns. These examples all rely on Keras, the Python deep learning library. When I released the initial version of Keras almost two years ago, little did I know that it would quickly skyrocket to become one of the most widely used deep learning frameworks, Al big part ofthat success is that Keras has always put ease of use and accessibility front and center. This same reason is what makes Keras a great library to get started with deep learning, and thus a great fit for this book, By the time you reach the end of this book, you Ih hope that you will this book valuable -deep learning will definitely open up new intellectual perspectives for you, and in fact it even has the potential to transform your career, being the most in-demand scientific specialization these days. I am looking forward to your reviews and comments, Your feedback is essential in order to write the best possible the latter chapters of this book. anyone, with very few prerequisites. will have become a Keras expert. book, that will benefit the greatest number of people.

1 What is Deep Learning? 1, 1 Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning In the past few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a subject of intense media hype. Machine learning, deep learning, and AI come up in countless articles, often outside of technology-minded publications, We are being promised a future of intelligent chatbots, self-driving cars, and virtual assistants a future sometimes painted in a grim light, and sometimes as an utopia, where human jobs would be scarce and most economic As a future or current practitioner of machine learning, it is important to be able to recognize the signal in the noise, to tell apart world-changing developments from what are merely over-hyped press releases, What is at stake is our future, and it is a future in which you have an active role to play: after reading this book, you will be part of those who develop the AIs, So let's tackle these questions -what has deep learning really achieved SO far? How significant is it? Where are we headed next? Should you believe First of all, we need to define clearly what we are talking about when we talk about AI. What is artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning? How do they activity would be handled by robots or AI agents, the hype? relate to each other?

2 1.1.1 Artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence was born in the 1950s, as a handful of pioneers from the nascent field of computer science started asking if computers could be made to "think"-a question whose ramifications we are still exploring today, A concise definition of the field would be: the effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans. As such, AI is a very general field which encompasses machine learning and deep learning, but also includes many more approaches that do not involve any learning, Early chess programs, for instance, only involved hard-coded rules crafted by programmers, and did not qualify as "machine learning". In fact, for a fairly long time many experts believed that human-level artificial intelligence could be achieved simply by having programmers handcraft a sufficiently large set of explicit rules for manipulating knowledge, This approach is known as "symbolic Al", and it was the dominant paradigm in AI from the 1950s to the late 1980s, It reached its peak popularity during the "expert Although symbolic AI proved suitable to solve well-defined, logical problems, such as playing chess, it turned out to be intractable to figure out explicit rules for solving more complex, fuzzy problems, such as image classification, speech recognition, or language translation. A new approach to AI arose to take its place: machine learning, In Victorian England, Lady Ada Lovelace was a friend and collaborator of Charles Babbage, the inventor of the "Analytical Engine", the first known design of a general-purpose computer a mechanical computer, Although visionary and far ahead of its time, the Analytical Engine wasn't actually meant as a general-purpose computer when it was designed in the 1830s and 1840s, since the concept of general-purpose computation was yet to be invented, It was merely meant as a way to use mechanical operations to automate certain computations from the field of mathematical analysis hence the name "analytical engine". In 1843, Ada Lovelace remarked on the "The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform, Its province is to assist us in making This remark was later quoted by AI pioneer Alan Turing as "Lady Lovelace's objection" in his landmark 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", which introduced the "Turing test" as well as key concepts that would come to shape AI, Turing was quoting Ada Lovelace while pondering whether general-purpose computers could be capable oflearning and originality, and he came to the conclusion that they could, Machine learning arises from this very question: could a computer go beyond "what we know how to order it to perform", and actually "learn" on its own how to perform a specified task? Could a computer surprise us? Rather than crafting data-processing rules by hand, could it be possible to automatically learn these rules by looking at data?
